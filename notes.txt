We need an easy way to add a new service to a running server.

Split services to their roles:
  - render docker-compose.yml.j2 into the client
  - set volume in the same folder (e.g. under _data) so it's easier to migrate to different server
  - having roles per service that would have "state:present" or "state:absent"


NiceToHave: Have a way how to migrate deployment from one server to another.
