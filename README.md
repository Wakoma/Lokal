# Lokal Services. Global Impact.

Open source glue for open source applications and services for content production, curation and sharing.

## What is it?

Lokal is a platform comprised of customizable open source software and services that enable communities and organizations to create, consume and communicate offline, or online where there is connectivity.  Lokal can run on most servers, whether it’s a Raspberry Pi, a [nimble](https://wakoma.co/nimble), or a virtual private server.

## Hasn’t something like this been built before? 

Yes, many, many times. Which is why we’re trying not to reinvent anything.  Slightly less than half of the world is offline - our intention is to make it easier for communities and organizations to get offline/local content and services running and configured without the high cost and hassle.

## What is different about Lokal than similar platforms?

Lokal is built to be offline first.  Users can run the services in a global server OR local server that runs offline or online.

We're also using and integrating services that enable network management, offgrid communications, live radio, content production, and other tools which are absent in a number of existing platforms but essential for communities without meaningful connectivity. 

## Where did Lokal start?
In 2018 Wakoma partnered with VPUU ([Violence Prevention Through Urban Upgrading](https://vpuu.org.za)) in South Africa to start [V-NET](http://vpuu.org.za/towards-a-community-circular-economy/bridging-the-digital-divide/), a wireless community network, to bring connectivity in townships and informal settlements around Cape Town.  As part of V-NET, our team started building V-Stack, a suite of offline content and services offered to local communities.   

What started as a small network connecting VPUU’s satellite offices has now become one of the largest community-based networks in South Africa, with over 75 hotspots, 40,000 unique users, and a 10Gbps+ backhaul capacity.  Wakoma is supporting the further development of the platform as 'Lokal' to meet the demands of V-NET, and enable other networks and communities to use and build on our progress to date. 

## What can it do?

The platform enables social eLearning (building, running and taking social courses), video and audio calling and messaging, high-speed file-sharing and synchronization, wireless network management, media streaming, collaborative document and spreadsheet creation, and much more.
