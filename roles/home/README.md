## Notes

- Official Docs recommend running in privileged mode (it appears to facilitate 
  the opening of serial ports for Z-Wave devices etc) which I have not done as it
  removes the benefits of running in a containerized environment.

- Official Docs recommend running in host networking mode, which is not implemented here.
