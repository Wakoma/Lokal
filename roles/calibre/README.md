**SECURITY WARNING**: we don't support setting admin password programatically
so please head to your calibre domain (most likely `books.{{domain}}`), login
with default credentials admin/admin123 and change the password!

Calibre-web will ask you to select valid calibre database. Select just the `data/`
folder (which resides in the default path `/app/calibre-web`. The data folder should
be visible right after you click into the folder icon in the file selector input.
