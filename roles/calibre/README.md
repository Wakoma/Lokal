# Calibre

**SECURITY WARNING**: we don't support setting admin password programatically
so please head to your calibre domain (most likely `books.{{domain}}`), login
with default credentials admin/admin123 and change the password!

Calibre-web will ask you to select valid calibre database and you can find one
in `/app/calibre-web/metadata.db`. It should be visible right after you click
into the folder icon in the file selector input.
